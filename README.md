# CleanMyMac Python

A Python-based Mac cleaner and maintenance tool with features similar to CleanMyMac. This utility provides system junk cleanup, trash management, large file finder, and system optimization utilities.

## Features

‚ú® **System Cleanup**
- Clean system and user cache files
- Empty trash bin
- Clean log files

üîç **File Management**
- Find large files (customizable size threshold)
- Find old files (customizable age threshold)

‚ö° **System Optimization**
- Free up RAM (purge command)
- Flush DNS cache
- Display disk usage statistics

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on macOS 10.15+)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gtuck/cleanmymac-python.git
cd cleanmymac-python
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x cleanmymac.py
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python3 cleanmymac.py
```

## Usage

Simply run the script and follow the interactive menu:

```bash
python3 cleanmymac.py
```

Or install/run as a console script (via `pyproject.toml`):

```
cleanmymac
```

### Non-interactive CLI

All actions are available as flags suitable for automation:

```
cleanmymac --clean-caches --clean-trash --clean-logs --yes
cleanmymac --all --yes
cleanmymac --find-large --min-size 500 --paths ~/Downloads ~/Documents --limit 50
cleanmymac --find-old --days 365
cleanmymac --disk-usage
cleanmymac --free-ram
sudo cleanmymac --flush-dns
```

Useful flags:
- `--dry-run` show what would be deleted, without deleting
- `--yes` non-interactive confirmation for delete operations
- `--log FILE` append a logfile of actions
- `--paths` target directories for finders (defaults to `$HOME`)
- `--limit` cap number of results for `--find-large` (default 20)

### Menu Options

1. **Clean system caches** - Removes cached files from ~/Library/Caches
2. **Empty trash** - Empties the trash bin (~/.Trash)
3. **Clean log files** - Removes .log and .txt files from ~/Library/Logs
4. **Find large files** - Searches for files larger than specified size (default 100MB)
5. **Find old files** - Searches for files older than specified days (default 180 days)
6. **Free up RAM** - Runs the macOS `purge` command to free inactive memory
7. **Flush DNS cache** - Clears the DNS cache
8. **Show disk usage** - Displays current disk space usage
9. **Run all cleaners** - Executes cache cleaning, trash emptying, and log cleaning together
10. **Empty per-volume trashes** - Empties `.Trashes/<uid>` or `.Trash` on mounted volumes under `/Volumes/*`
0. **Exit** - Quit the application

## Safety Features

- Uses only Python standard library (no external dependencies)
- Error handling for permission denied scenarios
- Skips system-critical directories (System, Library)
- Warns users before deleting files
- Shows size of files being cleaned

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This tool **DELETES FILES**. Always backup important data before running cleanup operations. Use at your own risk.

## Permissions & Full Disk Access

macOS privacy (TCC) can block Terminal from accessing some folders (Trash, external volumes). If you see "Permission denied" or "Operation not permitted":

- Grant your terminal app Full Disk Access:
  - System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Full Disk Access ‚Üí add Terminal/iTerm and enable it.
- The tool now uses the invoking user's home when run with sudo (via `SUDO_USER`), so Trash and user-level actions still target your account.
- When Trash access is blocked, the tool also tries an AppleScript fallback: `osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to empty trash'`.
 - DNS flushing is attempted only when already running as root; otherwise an informative message is shown.

Notes:
- Flushing DNS cache requires `sudo`.
- For user-level tasks (Trash, caches, logs), prefer running without `sudo`.
