# GitHub Copilot Instructions for CleanMyMac Python

## Overview
This document provides guidance for AI coding agents working on the CleanMyMac Python project. It outlines the architecture, workflows, conventions, and integration points to facilitate effective collaboration.

## Project Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.6+
- **Platform**: macOS
- **Core Functionality**: System cleanup, file management, and optimization.

## Workflows
1. **System Cleanup**: Functions to clean system caches and temporary files.
2. **File Management**: Commands to find and manage large or old files.
3. **Safety Features**: Ensure that operations do not delete critical system files.

## Conventions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use descriptive function and variable names.
- Document all functions with docstrings explaining parameters and return values.

## Integration Points
- Ensure compatibility with macOS permissions for file operations.
- Use standard library modules only, avoiding external dependencies.

## Usage Instructions
- To run the tool, execute `python cleanmymac.py` in the terminal.
- Follow prompts for specific cleanup operations.

## Conclusion
These instructions aim to streamline the development process for AI coding agents contributing to the CleanMyMac Python project. For further assistance, refer to the README.md or contact the project maintainers.
